customize arabic parser:
extract verbs only to apply Tashaphyne


past tense :
cant defere between 'ana anti anta hiya houwa'
cause:mafi tehrik

IDEAA:
using stemmer for english sentence,
only translate verb and get the correct morphology
So we choose the translation from the current database


TODO:
fi changes eemeloun bel library arlstem2 man3amaloun push aa github fix it or find .gitignore!!!!!!!!!!!!!
get root for words with h or al exemple:'gharadouHOU' 'AL walad' and create a fct to find the correct word

get a wider database and try the code with many more exemples

in test folder there is 2 methodes to remove AL in words to find them in the dictionnary

GUI: add scroll bar
     test with some word
     add transcript fct
     test

    fix DB , offline translator not working mac try it on toshiba
