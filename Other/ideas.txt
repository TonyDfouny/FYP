hebrew parser link:
https://pypi.org/project/hebspacy/#:~:text=A%20custom%20spaCy%20pipeline%20for,%2C%20PER%20%2C%20LOC%20and%20ORG%20.

Problems:
in english we,you,they have the same verb agreement.
we cant differ between "nahnou ""anta" "antom"

we may have to go back for arabic parser
or we can try hebrew

I can create a function to extract verb tense and the corresponding subject with its plurality and gender
but the  same problem will occur
examples:
Tony and his friends == They
Tony and I == We
Tony and yourself == You

in the 3 cases Tony is the subject for spacy but it is not enough to make the correct subject verb agreement
in addition to that the verb agreement needs to know the subject gender in order to make the correct phoenician
agreements

to show the confusion:
