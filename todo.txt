customize arabic parser:
extract verbs only to apply Tashaphyne


past tense :
cant defere between 'ana anti anta hiya houwa'
cause:mafi tehrik

find solution later on...


IDEAA:
using stemmer for english sentence,
only translate verb and get the correct morphology
So we choose the translation from the current database


TODO:
in arabic file create function Translate:
if non verb find translated word from dict and add it to output list
if verb:
    call verbgrammar fct and find translate and add it to output list
