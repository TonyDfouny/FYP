src:They found the coffin
verb correct but The coffing wasn't parsed as DTNN

src:He is collecting the silver
fully correct

src:I am collecting the silver--> ʾnk ʾr hksp  (same for both online and offline)
subject verb agremment did not work because:
['PRP انا', 'VBD اجمع', 'DTNN الفضة']
Which is an error because VBD means verb in PAST tense

if src is :He is collecting the silver -->hʾ yʾr hksp
['NNP انه', 'VBP يجمع', 'DTNN الفضة']
I put انه in the database as the pronoun He
VBP means present verb and so the algorithm worked in this case

Thats why there is a lot to fix in this method

#####ENGPHOE####
src=I collected the silver in Byblos -----> ʾnk ʾrt hksp b gbl
collected-->root 'ry -->agreement because of past pattern 'rt
silver --> ksp ---> the silver ---> hksp

src=I am collecting the silver in Byblos----> ʾnk ʾʾr hksp b gbl
ʾʾr is now the verb because of present pattern

I opened the coffin

Irregular verb in english in past like found , came ... should be added manually to the data

####PHOEENG######
hʾ yʾr hksp--->she yʾr the silver
cant differ between she and he alone we need to analyze the verb's prefix and suffix, and it didnt analyze
correctly the verb because it is not a strong pattern verb


ʾnk ptḥt hḥlt--->I *open the coffin
* is before open because changed were made to the word (removed a suffix)
a new code could be written to improve the output by analyzing the suffix removed and correspond it to the person
(like a reverse pattern). It Wasn't done due to a lack of time.
